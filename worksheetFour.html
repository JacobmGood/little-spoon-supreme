<h1>Worksheet 4</h1>
<h3>State a product or experience?</h3>
<p>	One product that made use of the empathy tools such as personas is the Ipod. This device allows users to browse audio, play audio, and rate audio. The focus of the Ipod was entertainment/ play. One of the targeted audience for this product would be a teen since younger generations would be more accepting of change, the ipod would be more likely used by an athletic user since activity allows the opportunity for music.</p>
