    <h1>Worksheet 3</h1>
<h3>Elements of empathy?</h3>
<p>Empathy is along the lines of being aware of, sensitive to, feelings of care, empathy at its roots is compassion for others.
   Empathy is something like a balanced curiosity that leads to a deeper understanding of another person. The three elements
    are emotion (the feeling people have towards products and services), culture (the diversity and array of personalities), 
    and context (the ability of people's understanding). 
</p>
<h3>Three business models and their problems?</h3>
<p>
Consumers, literally (type A personality)<br>
-    Only care about the customer purchasing their product or service, this leads to a customer being reduced to nothing but money bags.<br><br>
Sheep<br> 
-    Only sees customers as sheep and tries to herd them to their products and services through positioning, packing, and advertising.
The problem here is their product or service is being forced into everyone's faces.<br><br> 
Homo Economicus<br> 
-    Only cares about allocative efficiency and measuring human satisfaction. This model is very calculated and is highly driven by maximizing money.
 
</p>
<h3>Relate an element of empathy to each business model, explain why the model lacks this element?</h3>
<p><em>The Consumer, Literally model</em> lacks diversity and culture as it is assumed all the customers are organized, efficient and know 
  what they want. However, this is only one personality of people in society and not everyone knows exactly what they want.
  <br><br><em>The Sheep model</em> lacks context the most due beginning in a large number of consumers and having a disconnect between marketing and design, 
  many customers are lost in this confusing stream as it does not flow well.
  <br><br><em>The Homo Economicus model</em> lacks emotion as the model has no room to factor in how a person feels. The model uses a formula to 
  maximize its profits with the variables it has, human behavior is assumed to be rationalized unfortunately this is unrealistic.
