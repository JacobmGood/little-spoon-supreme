  <h1>What is the software development process?</h1>
  <p>The software development process is models of execution steps to building a software, each model has a different
    flow and degree of iterations. The waterfall model is a model that works best when the requirements are well
    understood as once the model moves onto the next increment it can not return, this model also will not have a 
    working version until the entire model is complete. The variation model is a contrast to the waterfall model. 
    The variation model builds in increments until an executable software is ready when it goes through increment 
    testing to fix code. This model is good if the client is not clear on requirements and will likely request 
    changes during production.

  <h1>Why is software design important?</h1>
  <p>
    Software design is divided into three main parts: Architectural design which is the construction of the 
    application structure to prepare the interconnection of code elements, High-level design is to make sure 
    theoretical concepts are interrelated for optimum results and creates a design to interconnect all modules
    to specific output finally, Detailed design is compilation of all modular outputs and arrangement. The design 
    of the backend code is the most important part of the design as comments and well labeled variables will allow 
    for updating code to be easier to understand. Having clean and readable code is more than a common curiosity in
    the workplace, having programmers work contract pieces is quite common and later down the line someone else may 
    need to read the code.

  <h1>A software that I think personally is designed well and why?</h1>
  <p>Adobe softwares is the best designed in my opinion as the programs are built for user friendly interaction, 
    each program is built for its intended purpose and files can be transferred from one program to another flawlessly. 
    Each program is built slightly differently however, they have many common design features: using the taskbar can 
    show all the windows and their features, each site will have an icon dropdown bar on the left for the most commonly 
    used features. The abode programs also have a cloud which can quickly access important aspects of files. While the 
    design is perfect most of the software is locked away behind a subscription.
