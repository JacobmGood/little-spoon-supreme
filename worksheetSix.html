<h1>Worksheet 6</h1>
<h3>Importance of Communication in Software Design</h3>
<p>Communication in software design is the ability to clearly get the understanding of how and what is to be designed. However, communication can lead to projects being interpreted in many different ways. It is important to ask the correct non leading questions to get a clear understanding in the requirements stage so the project turns out as all imagined.
</p>
<h3>Significance in Development Process & Some Key Benefits</h3>
<p>The significance of communication is to have everyone on the same page, writing documents and re-iterating throughout each stage of the process helps. Communication in the requirements stage is to communicate with the client. In the design stage, collaborative effort is to figure out how to build the project, prototype and run usability studies. 
</p>
<h4>Elements of Effective Communication</h4>
<p> - Collaborative meetings: such as brainstorming, technical reviews, implementation and testing. These collaborative meetings allow the team to figure out how they will build the project to meet all the requirements while building the project in a collaborative image that keeps everyone involved on the same page.<br><br>
 - Clear Communication enhances collaboration which in turns improves coordination. Listening to team members, being open to change and empathetic towards their ideas, being mindful and paying attention to others are all great attributes to lead to clear communication.<br><br>
 - Fairness to others is an effective way to keep the project more on point with what is required as a collaborative input on how to achieve the correct final product is always more desirable than one person's interpretation. This can be achieved by being positive, honest, flexible, culturally sensitive, and not pressuring others.
</p>
<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
<p>A common experience I go through is having to train new employees in a kitchen, the process usually goes pretty smoothly with the new hires as they are eager to learn and are typically shy at first while they feel out the situation. However, sometimes the new hire can have other kitchen experience and think they're above training or bring personal drama to work, this can lead to me having a rather poor communication throughout their training. To achieve effective communication I could put myself into their shoes to be more understanding and have clear communication about how a collaborative team member should be eager to learn/ teach.
