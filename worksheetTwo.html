    <h1>Worksheet 2</h1>
<h3>Requirements gathering stage?</h3>
<p>The software engineering process begins with inception(examining the problem), moves on to elicitation(gathering 
  requirements from stakeholders), negotiation(discussion on what is needed and what can be eliminated), problem 
  specification(develop a working model) and ends with review or validation of the specification(checking for errors 
  and debugging). The intent of this stage is to get a written understanding of the client's problem, it also establishes 
  a solid base for design and construction.  
</p>
<h3>Why is the requirements gathering stage important to the rest of the process?</h3>
<p>
  It is very important to make sure we understand the clients wants and needs before building a solution because a solution 
  that ignores the clients wants helps no one and just wastes everyone's time. Communicating a clear understanding will make 
  the rest of the process easier and leave less room for having to refix solutions.

<h3>Write user stories for the chosen program's last assignment?
</h3>
<p>The software I chose last week was Adobe due to its ability to interact with each of its specific programs. I'll be homing
   in on just one of the specific programs for this assignment, Photoshop.<br>  
<i>As a (user type), I want (some action/function), so that (some action/reason)</i><br>
    As a photographer, I want to be able to crop photos, so that I reduce the photo file size.<br>
    As a photographer, I want to be able to access my work in progress pieces through multiple platforms, so that I work 
    seamlessly through desktop, tablets and phones.<br>
    As a graphic designer, I want to be able to use a measured grid that divides the canvas evenly, so that I can neatly 
    space the layout of my designs.<br>
    As a graphic designer, I want to be able to change the display of colours from RGB to CMYK to match a printer, so that I 
    can see the proper look my work will print as.<br>
    As a graphic designer, I want a snapping tool for my elements, so that my elements are neatly flushed together.
