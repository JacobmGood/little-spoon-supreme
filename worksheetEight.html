<h1>Worksheet 8</h1>
<h2>Ethical Implications of Deceptive (dark) patterns</h2>
<h3>Hidden Subscriptions </h3>
<p>Software is not always free to use or interact with and can require a user to pay a subscription to use the product. However, software that does not alert or bring awareness to the product being a pay to use can be deceptive to the user, the software even will allow the user to use the software and then send the user charges for their usage. Recurring subscriptions that do not explicitly say it's recurring or alert the user of an upcoming charge are deceptive dark patterns. Ethical Implications of Deceptive (dark) patterns violate the ethical principles set by AMC.
</p>
<h3>AMC Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
<p>1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing - This code will be broken as the ability to inform people/ stakeholders of paid services is not met and is making the computer environment untrustworthy which does not promote human well-being as it breaches personal security. 
<br><br>
  1.2 Avoid harm. - This code is being broken as well as unwanted fees can be harmful to those living on a tight budget as hidden subscriptions are practically stealing. This leads to unjust mental harm by bringing unwanted stress. As money is the owners property, hidden subscriptions are causing unjust damage to private property. 
<br><br>  
  1.3 Be honest and trustworthy. - This code is broken as hiding costs is not honest or trustworthy as making deliberately false or misleading claims by making options seem free while in fact the software costs the user money is clearly misleading.
<br><br> 
  2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 are all violated
