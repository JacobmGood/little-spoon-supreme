<h1>Worksheet 7</h1>
<h3>The 80/20 Rule (The Pareto Principle)</h3>
<p>The 80/20 rule is a rule that suggests 20% of the input should equal 80% of the output and vice versa the other 80% of input equals the last 20% of the output. This principle implies that focusing on the most important work will in turn give the most amount of rewarding results. For example a company would focus on 20% of their most important clients that make up 80% of their client revenue. The drawback to the Pareto Principle is being forced to work on the most important aspects can limit creativity.
</p>
<h3>Importances in Software Design</h3>
<p>Not only is it important in terms of business as work vs result. The 80/20 rule specifically in software design applies that some iterations of the process are more important to spend more time on then others. Spending time on the design phase, buys you time in the long run by speeding up the implementation and producing better software.  
</p>
<h3>Pareto Principle in Action</h3>
<p>CourseLink used the 80/20 rule in designing their use cases for example CourseLink works quite smoothly when interacting with your classes content and grades. However, CourseLink attempted to make an “eportfolio” section but the only time it's been interacted with was twice in 2012. CourseLink also has courses that you can enroll in, although the UI is very inconsistent and information is lacking.<br>
  Another software that uses the 80/20 is google, google's main page is basically just a search bar in the middle and nothing around it. Google understood what users were most interested in and focused on that.
