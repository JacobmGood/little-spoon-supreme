<h1>Worksheet 5</h1>
<h3>Concept of Prototyping & Why we Prototype</h3>
<p>Prototyping is a non-functional mock up model that does not necessarily represent all aspects of the final application design but acts as a good representation that provides functionality of tasks and can have those functionalities tested for user friendly understanding. Prototyping is cheap and can easily make changes before implication. 
  The purpose of prototyping is to demonstrate design options, layout, and concepts. With the design the prototype can validate requirements, explore solutions, validate that the UI is usable, help identify if proposed structure fits users work model and understand usability studies. 
</p>
<h3>Significance in Development Process & Some Key Benefits</h3>
<p>The significance of prototyping in the development process allows for proof of concept to be tested by a user to help the design team understand what the user is thinking. The functionality and desirability of tasks is tested for clear and concise communication between user and application.   
</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p> - Improve system usability and design quality<br>
  Feedback from prototypes helps to redesign the system to be better understood by users' first glance and overall improve the quality by making the design more user friendly. This involves keeping the design less cluttered, not overwhelming the user with too many functions but while having all desirable functions easily locatable.<br><br>
  -  User real needs are considered in the design process<br>
  The needs of the user are clearly expressed in the prototype phase of the development process, these needs can be easily implemented into the design. <br><br>
  - Reduce development effort<br>
  Making changes in the prototype phase saves a lot of money and time as making changes later into the development can change the whole structure and may cause a lot of bugs and errors.
</p>
<h3>Basic Steps</h3>
<p> - Choose an important user<br>
- Determine some typical tasks<br>
- Make screenshots or sketches with paper<br>
- Perform a usability test
